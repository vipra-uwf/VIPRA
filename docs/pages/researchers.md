# Getting Started

## Setup and Run

View the steps to set up VIPRA at [Setup](getting_started/setup.md)

---

## Adding Modules

Learn more about the included modules at [Included Modules](base_modules.md)

Learn more about the types of modules and how to add additional modules at [Modules](modules.md)

---

## Behaviors

Human behaviors can be modified and added to the simulation through the [VIPRA Behaviors DSL](behaviors/VIPRA_behaviors.md)

Examples of behaviors can be found at [Behavior Examples](behaviors/behavior_examples.md)

To add behaviors, follow the instructions in [Adding Behaviors](behaviors/adding_behaviors.md)

---

## Simulation Output

Simulation output is discussed in detail in [Output](modules/output.md)

---

## Parameter Sweep

Parallel Processing and Randomized parameters can be achieved through a [Parameter Sweep](parameter_sweep.md)

---

## Visualizer

The included visualizer program allows for the viewing of simulation output as a video or animated image format.

The Python-based tool is located under tools/trajectories_visualizer/visualize.py

For more information on how to use this tool, go to [Visualizer]()
