# VIPRA Behaviors

VIPRA Behaviors is a DSL for creating human behaviors for use in pedestrian dynamics simulations.
Its goal is to provide an easy way for researchers without programming experience to test how human behaviors may affect pedestrian dynamics.

`Behaviors` are a way to describe `Actions` that pedestrians take under a certain `Condition` without the use of a traditional programming language.

`Behaviors` are comprised of four major parts:
1. [Types](#types)
2. [Selectors](#selectors)
3. [Events](#events)
4. [Actions](#actions)
